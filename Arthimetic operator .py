a = 20
b = 10
c = a+b #Here C is sum of a and b
print("Value of c is",c)#c=20+10,So c is 30

F = 20
D = 10
G = F-D #Here G is subtraction of F and D
print("Value of G is",G)#G=20-10, So G is 10

p = 20
l = 10
o = p*l #Here o is Multiplication of p and l
print("Value of o is",o)#0=20*10, So o is 30

w = 20
q = 10
s = w / q #Here the w is divided by q.
print("Value of s is",s)#s=20/10, So o is 2
